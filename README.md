# Random-Portfolio-vs-Benchmark-Strategy
Building on the popular work of the WallStreet Journal with the monkey darts stock picking experiment, this Python project models the performance of randomly generated portfolios and plots it against a benchmark. The aim is to visualise if randomly picked portfolios with the same number of constituent stocks as the benchmark can outperform the benchmark itself.
